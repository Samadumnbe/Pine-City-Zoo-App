                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally
                    recognosed, the African elephant(Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (elephas maximus).
                    Elephants are scattered throughtout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southest Asia. Male African elephants 
                    are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4m (13 ft) and weigh 7000kg (15,000 lb).</p>
                   <p> All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many 
                    purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
                    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephant's large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.
                    Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have large ears and concave backs while Asian 
                    elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes.
                    They prefer to say near water.<br>
                    <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong>
                    You will find the elephants at the pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.
